# 🏨 Booking.com Hotel Data Web Scraping & Analysis

An end to end data pipeline that collects hotel information from Booking.com, cleans the data and prepares an analysis ready dataset with engineered features for downstream analytics and machine learning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a real world data workflow starting from automated web scraping to structured dataset creation.

Hotel information such as name, city, price and customer ratings was extracted using browser automation and HTML parsing techniques. The raw data was then cleaned, transformed and enriched with analytical features to enable meaningful insights.

The final dataset can support travel analytics, recommendation systems and predictive modeling.
